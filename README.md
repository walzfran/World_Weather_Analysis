# World_Weather_Analysis

### Overview of Project

#### For this module we worked on using API keys to formulate data in our python code. This pulls information from a database online and generates in into usable information that we can then create maps to display what our user is looking for. 

#### In this particular project we used google maps to display weather maps so that the user can generate potential vacation destinations based on a temperature range. We wrote code to ask users to input a range of temperatures which then displays a list of locations. The location information shows the city, country, latitude, longitude, maximum temperature, cloudiness and a weather description as well as a hotel that is located nearby the destination. 

#### With all of the information that we pulled in our dataframe we then used it to show 4 locations that are close enought for easy travel that also shows directions by driving. When the user looks at the map they can click on the cities to see information that pertains to the weather, there is also hotel information that the guest can see in our dataframes if they will need lodging. Below is a screenshot that depicts the map.

#### This is useful for users that are looking to map out a route to take when looking to visit places based on weather they are looking for.
